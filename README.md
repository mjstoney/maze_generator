### Maze Generator in Proceessing/Java.
This app runs in Processing and generates a unique maze each time. 
It uses an iterative backtracking algorithm, and currently a player can move a red square throughout the maze.

### TODO
- Implement other maze generation algorithms
- Implement a command line interface or GUI to select algorithms
- Add a randomized start and goal marker for player
- Add a visible timer
- Write raytracing algorithm to make pseudo-3D
- Add textures
- Find hosting solution (maybe port to other language)
