### Maze Generator in Proceessing/Java.
<p>This app runs in Processing and generates a unique maze each time. </p>
It uses an iterative backtracking algorithm, found [here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Iterative_implementation). Currently a player can move a red square throughout the maze.

### TODO
- Implement other maze generation algorithms
- Implement a command line interface or GUI to select algorithms
- Add a randomized start and goal marker for player
- Add a visible timer
- Write raytracing algorithm to make pseudo-3D
- Add textures
- Find hosting solution (maybe port to other language)
